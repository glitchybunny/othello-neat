I've included a few different trained genomes in the repository to play around with.

Alice
Alice was trained on a previous, broken version of the game
It's very, very easy to beat

Bob
Bob was trained on a less broken version of the game, but still has quite a few issues
It's very easy to beat

Charlie
Charlie is the first network to be trained for a significant amount of time.
It's trained against random agents, and hasn't developed very good strategies, but it's still a good challenge for a new player.

Dave
Dave is the first moderately challenging AI. It was trained on a combination of random agents and against itself.
It has quite a few decent strategies and was the first AI to beat me in a game. I'm proud of Dave.
