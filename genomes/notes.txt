I've included a few different trained genomes in the repository to play around with.

Alice
A was trained on a broken version of the game
A is no smarter than a random agent

Bob
B was trained on a less-broken version of the game
B is better than random, but still very easy

Charlie
C is the first network to be trained for a significant amount of time
C hasn't developed very good strategies, but is still a formidable opponent
C should serve as an interesting challenge for new players

Dave
D is the first moderately challenging AI
D was trained against itself and random agents
D was the first genome to beat me - I'm proud of you, Dave

Elbertson
E has been trained against random agents and itself, using different scoring systems and parameters
E is not as good as I'd hoped, given the sheer amount of games it's been trained on. This is probably because each game between AIs only has 8 different outcomes.
