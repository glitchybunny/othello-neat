I've included a few different trained genomes in the repository to play around with.

Alice
A was trained on a broken version of the game
A is no smarter than a random agent

Bob
B was trained on a less-broken version of the game
B is better than random, but still very easy

Charlie
C is the first network to be trained for a significant amount of time
C hasn't developed very good strategies, but is still a formidable opponent
C should serve as an interesting challenge for new players

Dave
D is the first moderately challenging AI
D was trained against itself and random agents
D was the first genome to beat me - I'm proud of you, Dave

Elbertson
E has been trained against random agents and itself, using different scoring systems and parameters
E is not as good as I'd hoped, given the sheer amount of games it's been trained on. This is probably because each game between AIs only has 8 different outcomes.

Gary
G is designed to lose. It intentionally tries to lose the game so the human player feels good about themselves.
It's far more fun to play against than any of the other bots.
