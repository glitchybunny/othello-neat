I've included a few different trained genomes in the repository to play around with.

Alice
A was trained on a previous, broken version of the game.
It's very, very easy to beat, and no more difficult than random.

Bob
B was trained on a less broken version of the game, but still has quite a few issues.
It's very easy to beat

Charlie
C is the first network to be trained for a significant amount of time.
It's trained against random agents, and hasn't developed very good strategies,
but it's still a interesting challenge for a new player.

Dave
D is the first moderately challenging AI. D plays significantly better when playing as black.
It was trained on a combination of random agents and against itself.
It has quite a few decent strategies and was the first AI to beat me in a game.
I'm proud of you, Dave.
